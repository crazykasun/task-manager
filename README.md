## What I Could Do With More Time

1. **User Authentication and Login Function**  
   Adding proper user authentication would be one of my first priorities. With JWT, users could log in securely. A login page that connects to the backend roles would make the app feel much more complete.

2. **Improved Design**  
   By using tools like TailwindCSS or Material-UI, I could give the interface a fresh, polished look. Features like dark mode or drag-and-drop for tasks would be interesting.

3. **Advanced Task Features**  
   Expanding the task features would take the app to the next level. This could include setting due dates and reminders or marking tasks with priorities.

4. **Better Error Handling and Feedback**  
   Right now, error messages are basic, but they could be improved to provide more clarity. Adding success notifications or helpful hints would make the app feel more polished and professional.

5. **Cloud Deployment and Scalability**  
   Hosting the app on a cloud platform like AWS or Azure would be great. Optimizing the backend would ensure it performs well, even with larger datasets or more concurrent users.

6. **Code Comments**  
   If I had more time, I would add more comments to the code to make it easier for others (and my future self) to understand and maintain.
